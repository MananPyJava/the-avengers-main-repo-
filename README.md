# Student Assistant

We are two friends Manan Gandhi and Daksh Desai. We have made this repository for the Timathon or Tech With Tim Code Jam. In this repository, we have used python as our main language. The GUI is made with the Python module named Tkinter.


## What is Student Assistant
The theme for the Timathon is Students. So, this project is made to help students when they study. Some of its features are:
- Wikipedia Search
- Search basic properties of elements
- Most commonly used formulae for Physics
- Sleep detector which checks whether a student is sleeping while studying

We have made this project with the aim that during the Covid-19 times, online studies of students shall not be hampered. Their doubts shall be solved. We have made this project by taking in mind, the problems students face while studying.
